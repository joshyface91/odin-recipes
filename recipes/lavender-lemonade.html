    <h4>Description</h4>
    <p>
        In ancient times lavender was used for mummification and perfume by the Egyptian’s, Phoenicians, and peoples of Arabia.  The Greeks and the Romans bathed in lavender scented water and it was from the Latin word “lavo” meaning “to wash” that the herb took it’s name.  Perhaps first domesticated by the Arabians, lavender spread across Europe from Greece.  Around 600 BC lavender may have come from the Greek Hyeres Islands into France and is now common in France, Spain, Italy and England.

        Queen Elizabeth I of England valued lavender as a conserve and a perfume.  It has been said that she commanded that the royal table should never be without conserve of lavender and she issued orders to her gardeners that fresh lavender flowers should be available all year round!  She also drank an abundance of Lavender tea to help ease her migraines and used it as a body perfume.

    <h4>Ingredients</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>6 cups water</li>
        <li>½ cup granulated sugar</li>
        <li>¼ cup honey</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons dried culinary lavender</li>
        <li>2 cups freshly squeezed lemon juice</li>
        <li>Blue or purple food coloring</li>
        <li>Lemon slices (for garnish)</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Process</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Over medium heat, combine 2 cups of water and the sugar, bringing to a boil until the sugar is dissolved. Turn off the heat and stir in the honey and lavender.</li>
        <li>Allow the mixture to steep for 2 hours (less if you want less of a lavender taste).</li>
        <li>Strain the liquid, pressing the lavender down to make sure you get all of those juices into your mixture!</li>
        <li>In a large pitcher, combine freshly squeezed lemon juice, lavender mixture and the remaining 4 cups of water.</li>
        <li>Feel free to add a couple drops of blue or purple food coloring if you want more color than the lavender provides. Makes the lemonade especially cute for those brunches! Serve over ice.</li>
    </ol>
